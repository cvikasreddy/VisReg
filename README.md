# VisReg
Implementation of the visualization regularizer (https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.02646) for neural networks trained on image tasks.

Instructions
============

Pre-requisites
--------------
The following python packages are required to be installed:
* Tensorflow: https://www.tensorflow.org/

File organization
-------------------------------------------
* Data is located in cifar/data and mnist/data.
* Logs generated by tensorflow summarywriter is stored in cifar/logs and mnist/logs.
* Models are stored in cifar/models and mnist/models.

Training
--------
The file mnist/train.py and cifar/train.py can be used to train the appropriate model by changing the parameters beta, gamma, theta for L2, VR2, VR1 regularizer coffecients.
